# Softimage XSI 3.0 Exporter for Blender 4.2

--------------------------------

To use, create a folder called "io_scene_xsi3" in your blender addons folder.
Extract the files into the new folder, open blender, and activate the addon in preferences.
Search for "Softimage XSI 3.0 Format" in addons.

The menu options under file -> import and file -> export will then be available.

--------------------------------

This addon is based off of the 'io_scene_bz2xsi' addon by frute94 which can be found here:
https://github.com/frute94/io_scene_bz2xsi

Changes:
- Modified to export the standard XSI 3.0 format.
- Added export options for Jedi Outcast/Academy's "carcass" program.
